=head1 NAME

IPC::DirQueue - disk-based many-to-many task queue

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $dq = IPC::DirQueue->new({ dir => "/path/to/queue" });
    $dq->enqueue_file("filename");

    my $dq = IPC::DirQueue->new({ dir => "/path/to/queue" });
    my $job = $dq->pickup_queued_job();
    if (!$job) { print "no jobs left\n"; exit; }
    # ...do something interesting with $job->get_data_path() ...
    $job->finish();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a FIFO queueing infrastructure, using a directory
as the communications and storage media.  No daemon process is required to
manage the queue; all communication takes place via the filesystem.

A common UNIX system design pattern is to use a tool like C<lpr> as a task
queueing system; for example,
C<http://patrick.wagstrom.net/old/weblog/archives/000128.html> describes the
use of C<lpr> as an MP3 jukebox.

However, C<lpr> isn't as efficient as it could be.  When used in this way, you
have to restart each task processor for every new task.  If you have a lot of
startup overhead, this can be very inefficient.   With C<IPC::DirQueue>, a
processing server can run persistently and cache data needed across multiple
tasks efficiently; it will not be restarted unless you restart it.

Multiple enqueueing and dequeueing processes on multiple hosts (NFS-safe
locking is used) can run simultaneously, and safely, on the same queue.

Since multiple dequeuers can run simultaneously, this provides a good way
to process a variable level of incoming tasks using a pre-defined number
of worker processes.

If you need more CPU power working on a queue, you can simply start
another dequeuer to help out.  If you need less, kill off a few dequeuers.

If you need to take down the server to perform some maintainance or
upgrades, just kill the dequeuer processes, perform the work, and start up
new ones. Since there's no 'socket' or similar point of failure aside from
the directory itself, the queue will just quietly fill with waiting jobs
until the new dequeuer is ready.

Arbitrary 'name = value' string-pair metadata can be transferred alongside data
files.   In fact, in some cases, you may find it easier to send unused and
empty data files, and just use the 'metadata' fields to transfer the details of
what will be worked on.

=item $dq->new ($opts);

Create a new queue object, suitable for either enqueueing jobs
or picking up already-queued jobs for processing.

C<$opts> is a reference to a hash, which may contain the following
options:

=over 4

=item dir => $path_to_directory (no default)

Name the directory where the queue files are stored.  This is required.

=item data_file_mode => $mode (default: 0666)

The C<chmod>-style file mode for data files.  This should be specified
as a string with a leading 0.  It will be affected by the current
process C<umask>.

=item queue_file_mode => $mode (default: 0666)

The C<chmod>-style file mode for queue control files.  This should be
specified as a string with a leading 0.  It will be affected by the
current process C<umask>.

=item ordered => { 0 | 1 } (default: 1)

Whether the jobs should be processed in order of submission, or
in no particular order.

=item queue_fanout => { 0 | 1 } (default: 0)

Whether the queue directory should be 'fanned out'.  This allows better
scalability with NFS-shared queues with large numbers of pending files, but
hurts performance otherwise.   It also implies B<ordered> = 0. (This is
strictly experimental, has overall poor performance, and is not recommended.)

=item indexd_uri => $uri (default: undef)

A URI of a C<dq-indexd> daemon, used to maintain the list of waiting jobs.  The
URI must be of the form  C<dq://hostname[:port]> . (This is strictly
experimental, and is not recommended.)

=item buf_size => $number (default: 65536)

The buffer size to use when copying files, in bytes.

=item active_file_lifetime => $number (default: 600)

The lifetime of an untouched active lockfile, in seconds.  See 'STALE LOCKS AND
SIGNAL HANDLING', below, for more details.

=item $dq->enqueue_file ($filename [, $metadata [, $pri] ] );

Enqueue a new job for processing. Returns C<1> if the job was enqueued, or
C<undef> on failure.

C<$metadata> is an optional hash reference; every item of metadata will be
available to worker processes on the C<IPC::DirQueue::Job> object, in the
C<$job-E<gt>{metadata}> hashref.  Note that using this channel for metadata
brings with it several restrictions:

=over 4

=item 1. it requires that the metadata be stored as 'name' => 'value' string pairs

=item 2. neither 'name' nor 'value' may contain newline (\r) or NUL (\0) characters

=item 3. 'name' cannot contain colon characters

=item 4. 'name' cannot start with a capital 'Q' and be 4 characters in length

=back

If those restrictions are broken, die() will be called with the following
error:

      die "IPC::DirQueue: invalid metadatum: '$k'";

This is a change added in release 0.06; prior to that, that metadatum would be
silently dropped.

An optional priority can be specified; lower priorities are run first.
Priorities range from 0 to 99, and 50 is default.

}

=item $dq->enqueue_fh ($filehandle [, $metadata [, $pri] ] );

Enqueue a new job for processing. Returns C<1> if the job was enqueued, or
C<undef> on failure. C<$pri> and C<$metadata> are as described in
C<$dq-E<gt>enqueue_file()>.  C<$filehandle> is a perl file handle
that must be open for reading.  It will be closed on completion,
regardless of success or failure.

Enqueue a new job for processing.  The job data is entirely read from

C<$pri> and C<$metadata> are as described in C<$dq-E<gt>enqueue_file()>.

=item $dq->enqueue_sub ($subref [, $metadata [, $pri] ] );

Enqueue a new job for processing. Returns C<1> if the job was enqueued, or
C<undef> on failure. C<$pri> and C<$metadata> are as described in
C<$dq-E<gt>enqueue_file()>.

C<$subref> is a perl subroutine, which is expected to return one of the
following each time it is called:

    - a string of data bytes to be appended to any existing data.  (the
      string may be empty, C<''>, in which case it's a no-op.)

    - C<undef> when the enqueued data has ended, ie. EOF.

    - C<die()> if an error occurs.  The C<die()> message will be converted into
      a warning, and the C<enqueue_sub()> call will return C<undef>.

(Tip: note that this is a closure, so variables outside the subroutine can be
accessed safely.)

=item $job = $dq->wait_for_queued_job ([ $timeout [, $pollinterval] ]);

Wait for a job to be queued within the next C<$timeout> seconds.

If there is already a job ready for processing, this will return immediately.
If one is not available, it will sleep, wake up periodically, check for job
availabilty, and either carry on sleeping or return the new job if one
is now available.

If a job becomes available, a new instance of C<IPC::DirQueue::Job> is
returned. If the timeout is reached, C<undef> is returned.

If C<$timeout> is not specified, or is less than 1, this function will wait
indefinitely.

The optional parameter C<$pollinterval> indicates how frequently to wake
up and check for new jobs.  It is specified in seconds, and floating-point
precision is supported.  The default is C<1>.

Note that if C<$timeout> is not a round multiple of C<$pollinterval>,
the nearest round multiple of C<$pollinterval> greater than C<$timeout>
will be used instead.  Also note that C<$timeout> is used as an integer.

=item $job = $dq->visit_all_jobs($visitor, $visitcontext);

Visit all the jobs in the queue, in a read-only mode.  Used to list
the entire queue.

The callback function C<$visitor> will be called for each job in
the queue, like so:

  &$visitor ($visitcontext, $job);

C<$visitcontext> is whatever you pass in that variable above.
C<$job> is a new, read-only instance of C<IPC::DirQueue::Job> representing
that job.

If a job is active (being processed), the C<$job> object also contains the
following additional data:

  'active_host': the hostname on which the job is active
  'active_pid': the process ID of the process which picked up the job

=head1 STALE LOCKS AND SIGNAL HANDLING

If interrupted or terminated, dequeueing processes should be careful to either
call C<$job-E<gt>finish()> or C<$job-E<gt>return_to_queue()> on any active
tasks before exiting -- otherwise those jobs will remain marked I<active>.

Dequeueing processes can also call C<$job-E<gt>touch_active_lock()>
periodically, while processing large tasks, to ensure that the task is still
marked as I<active>.

Stale locks are normally dealt with automatically.  If a lock is still
I<active> after about 10 minutes of inactivity, the other dequeuers on
that machine will probe the process ID listed in that lock file using
C<kill(0)>.  If that process ID is no longer running, the lock is presumed
likely to be stale. If a given timeout (10 minutes plus a random value
between 0 and 256 seconds) has elapsed since the lock file was last
modified, the lock file is deleted.

This 10-minute default can be modified using the C<active_file_lifetime>
parameter to the C<IPC::DirQueue> constructor.

Note: this means that if the dequeueing processes are spread among
multiple machines, and there is no longer a dequeuer running on the
machine that initially 'locked' the task, it will never be unlocked,
unless you delete the I<active> file for that task.

=head1 QUEUE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

C<IPC::DirQueue> maintains the following structure for a queue directory:

=over 4

=item queue directory

The B<queue> directory is used to store the queue control files.  Queue
control files determine what jobs are in the queue; if a job has a queue
control file in this directory, it is listed in the queue.

The filename format is as follows:

    50.20040909232529941258.HASH[.PID.RAND]

The first two digits (C<50>) are the priority of the job.  Lower priority
numbers are run first.  C<20040909232529> is the current date and time when the
enqueueing process ran, in C<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS> format.   C<941258> is the time in
microseconds, as returned by C<gettimeofday()>.  And finally, C<HASH> is a
variable-length hash of some semi-random data, used to increase the chance of
uniqueness.

If there is a collision, the timestamps are regenerated after a 250 msec sleep,
and further randomness will be added at the end of the string (namely, the
current process ID and a random integer value).   Multiple retries are
attempted until the file is atomically moved into the B<queue> directory
without collision.

If B<queue_fanout> was used in the C<IPC::DirQueue> constructor, then
the B<queue> directory does not contain the queue control files directly;
instead, there is an interposing set of 16 'fanout' directories, named
according to the hex digits from C<0> to C<f>.

=item active directory

The B<active> directory is used to store active queue control files.

When a job becomes 'active' -- ie. is picked up by C<pickup_queued_job()> --
its control file is moved from the B<queue> directory into the B<active>
directory while it is processed.

=item data directory

The B<data> directory is used to store enqueued data files.

It contains a two-level "fan-out" hashed directory structure; each data file is
stored under a single-letter directory, which in turn is under a single-letter
directory.   This increases efficiency of directory lookups.

The format of filenames here is similar to that used in the B<queue> directory,
except that the last two characters are removed and used instead for the
"fan-out" directory names.

=item tmp directory

The B<tmp> directory contains temporary work files that are in the process
of enqueueing, and not ready ready for processing.

The filename format here is similar to the above, with suffixes indicating
the type of file (".ctrl", ".data").

=back

Atomic, NFS-safe renaming is used to avoid collisions, overwriting or
other unsafe operations.
